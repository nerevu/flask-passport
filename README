Flask-Passport
==============

Adds authorization and authentication support to your Flask application.

I haven't used this since I wrote it back in 2011 so I can't really guarantee it
will work on modern-day Flask. Also, security is dangerous stuff. Use something
well known instead. I spent an alarming amount of time documenting it, so I
figured I should keep it around and treat it as a proof of concept.
